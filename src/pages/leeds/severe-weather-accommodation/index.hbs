      <p>During periods of severe cold weather, additional emergency accommodation is provided by the council (often referred to as SWEP).</p>
      <p>The Council has signed up to a long standing government protocol to find accommodation for any person who requires it, irrespective of legal duty, when the temperature is forecast to be below zero for two nights in succession.</p>
      <p>The Leeds approach <em>exceeds the government protocol described above</em>, in that the arrangements are activated if the temperature is forecast to be below zero for one night and are not suspended until the first standard working day after the temperature has risen above zero. This means that during the period that Severe Weather Provision (SWP) arrangements are in place, no one needs to sleep on the streets of Leeds.</p>

      <p>The arrangements are co-ordinated by Leeds City Council’s Leeds Housing Options service with partner agencies including the Police, Commissioned accommodation services, homeless charities and the voluntary sector. Various commissioned accommodation providers supply extra beds to provide a larger resource during this time with <a href="/find-help/organisation/?organisation=st-georges-crypt">St Georges Crypt</a> being the central service utilised. In total there are 23 additional beds provided during periods of severe weather.</p>
      <p>In Leeds during the last three years there has always been sufficient bed spaces during periods of severe weather. Some of the good practice learned through previous severe weather periods has been carried on into daily use and there are now members of staff in attendance at key locations such as <a href="/find-help/organisation/?organisation=st-georges-crypt">St Georges Crypt</a> throughout the year to promote move on work and help homeless people access longer term accommodation.</p>
