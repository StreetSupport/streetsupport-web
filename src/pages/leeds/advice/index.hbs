      <h2 class="h2">Advice on Housing Options</h2>
      <p><a href="https://www.leeds.gov.uk/residents/housing/housing-options">Leeds Housing Options</a> will be able to give you the best advice for your individual circumstances. They can help in lots of different ways to either prevent you from becoming homeless or assist you with moving into a new property.</p>
      <p>.In order to apply for homelessness assistance from Leeds City Council you will need to take part in a housing needs assessment (*). There are different ways to be assessed:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Visit 2 Great George Street on the first floor between 8:30am - 4pm Monday to Thursdays or 9:30am - 4pm on Fridays.</li>
        <li>Call 0113 222 4412 to request a telephone appointment or a home visit.</li>
        <li>Attend one of their surgeries accross the city (further information to follow)</li>
        <li>In an emergency outside of office hours you can call 07891 273 939 (17:00-8:00.)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>* Homelessness assessment revolves around the 5 tests of homelessness. These tests decide whether or not the council has a legal duty to rehouse you. Even if there is no legal duty the council will always provide extensive advice and assistance to resolve your housing need. Once the assessment is complete, the council can assist you with either staying in your current property or moving on into social or privately rented housing. If you are in urgent need, you may qualify for temporary accommodation but not before all other options have been explored.</p>
      <p>There is more <a href="https://www.leeds.gov.uk/residents/housing/housing-options/leeds-housing-options">official information on homelessness from Leeds council</a>, or you can contact Shelter for advice on 0808 800 4444.</p>
