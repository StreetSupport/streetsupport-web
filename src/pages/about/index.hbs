      <p>Street Support Network is a central online resource around homelessness in a city, currently available in Greater Manchester, Leeds, Bradford, Liverpool, Bournemouth, Portsmouth & Southampton.</p>
      <p>We have a simple mission - to make it easier for people who are homeless to get the help they need...</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="/find-help/">Find Help</a>: See exactly when and where support is available, and where there are gaps.</li>
        <li>
          <a href="/give-help/">Give Help</a>: See what is needed across all organisations - volunteer, offer items, or donate.</li>
        <li>
          <a href="http://news.streetsupport.net/">News</a>: Learn about homelessness in the city through stories, information, and news updates.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We make it easier for local organisations to collaborate and co-ordinate, and we make it easier for citizens and businesses to know how to help.</p>
      <p>Our long term vision is a place-driven citizen-led support network, with people with personal lived experience of homelessness at the heart of everything we do.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">Our Team</h2>

      <p>We have a core team of 6 people based in Manchester, 3 of us have lived experience of homelessness. Each city also has a network co-ordinator, supported by local organisations and volunteers.</p>

        <span class="btn__text">About our team</span>
      </a>

      <p>We use research, co-production, human centered design and creative technology to develop online tools that make it easier for people experiencing homelessness to get help. We also facilitate discussion and co-production, and work behind the scenes to connect the network. Here is a little story of where this idea came from:
        <a href="/about/how-this-started/">How this started.</a>
      </p>

      <h2 class="h2">Our Organisation</h2>
      <p>Street Support Network Ltd is a Registered Charity [1177546]. We have been funded by donations from local philanthropists and friends, small grants, and business sponsorship. We always pay at least the real living wage.</p>
      <p>In order to continue to develop and improve this central resource, and to facilitate change through the network, we are looking for businesses to sponsor us to help grow out team, providing more opportunities for people who have experienced homelessness.

      <h2 class="h2">Partnership</h2>
      <p>We work in partnership with people experiencing homelessess, charities and voluntary groups, public and private sector, and concerned citizens. We work together to co-produce new features to meet the needs of those who will use them, and are continually improving the site based on user feedback. In addition to providing the online network, we also work behind the scenes to connect people and facilitate collaborative workshops.</p>
