      <p>Street Support Network is a central online resource around homelessness in a city, currently available in Greater Manchester,
        Leeds, Bradford, Bournemouth, Portsmouth & Liverpool, with other cities keen to join.</p>
      <p>We have a simple mission - to make it easier for people who are homeless to get the help they need...</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="/find-help/">Find Help</a>: See exactly when and where support is available, and where there are gaps.</li>
        <li>
          <a href="/give-help/">Give Help</a>: See what is needed across all organisations - volunteer, offer items, or donate.</li>
        <li>
          <a href="http://news.streetsupport.net/">News</a>: Learn about homelessness in the city through stories, information, and news updates.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We make it easier for the local network of services to collaborate, co-ordinate and provide better support for people
        experiencing homelessness, and we make it easier for citizens and businesses to do something to help. Many small,
        co-ordinated actions add up to a big difference to homeless people in the city.</p>
      <p>Our long term vision is a place-driven citizen-led support network, with people with personal lived experience of homelessness
        at the heart of everything we do.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">Our Organisation</h2>
      <p>Street Support Network Ltd is a charity - our Registered Charity Number is 1177546. We have been funded so far by donations

      <p>In order to continue to develop and improve this central resource, and to facilitate change through the network, we

      <h2 class="h2">Our Team</h2>

      <p>We have a core team of 6 people based in Manchester, 3 of us have lived experience of homelessness. Each city also has a network co-ordinator, supported by local organisations and volunteers.</p>
      <a href="/about/our-team/" class="btn btn--brand-d btn--in-copy">
        <span class="btn__text">About our team</span>
      </a>

      <p>We have a small core team of 4 people based in Manchester, 2 of which have recent lived experience of homelessness.
        Each city also has a local network and co-ordinator, and we are supported by a network of digital experts and volunteers.</p>

      <p>We use research, co-production, human centered design and creative technology to develop online tools that make it
        easier for people experiencing homelessness to get help. We also facilitate discussion and co-production, and work
        behind the scenes to connect the network. Here is a little story of where this idea came from:

      <h2 class="h2">Partnership</h2>
      <p>We work in partnership with people experiencing homelessess, charities and voluntary groups, public and private sector,
        and concerned citizens. We work together to co-produce new features to meet the needs of those who will use them,
        and are continually improving the site based on user feedback. In addition to providing the online network, we also
        work behind the scenes to connect people and facilitate collaborative workshops.</p>
