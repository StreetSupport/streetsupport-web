      <p>Street Support is a central digital hub, uniting all the charities and voluntary groups that support homeless people in Manchester, with all those whoâ€™d like to help, so that together we can make a bigger impact.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Through our <a href="/find-help/">Find Help</a> section you can find local services to meet the specific needs of an individual, through a smartphone.</li>
        <li>Through our <a href="/give-help/">Give Help</a> section you can find out what items, money or people local homelessness organisations currently need - simple and effective ways to take action.</li>
        <li>Through <a href="charter.streetsupport.net">Manchester Homelessness Charter</a> section you can support a wide partnership of organisations, service providers and businesses to end homelessness in Manchester.</li>
      </ul> 
      <p>This allows the Manchester network to collaborate, co-ordinate and provide better support for people experiencing homelessness. Many small, co-ordinated actions add up to a big difference to homeless people in Manchester.</p>
      <p>Whoever you are, and however you can, please get involved. If you would like to get involved, you can get regular updates from Street Support by adding your details to the <a href="/join-street-support/">Street Support supporters list here.</a></p>
      
      <h2 class="h2">About us</h2>
      <p>We are a collective of digital experts, working closely alongside homelessness people in Manchester and the organisations that support them. We use research, user centered design and creative technology to build online tools that make it easier for people experiencing homelessness to get the help they need.</p>
      <p>We started the project in October 2015 with a small core team of 3, and have developed the site with the help of our network of digital experts. You can read more about the team behind Street Support here: <a href="about-our-team/">About our team</a>.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">What next?</h2>
      <p>There are many more features we would love to add to Street Support, and are continually looking to improve the experience based on your feedback. We are currently improving the Give Help section, working on a central skills database, and a blog. We are also adding content to the Charter section to show updates as progress is made.</p>
      <p>Longer term, we want to offer these tools to other locations, and eventually create a wide Street Support Network accross the UK and beyond.</p>
      <p>We have been funded so far by donations from local philanthropists and a loan from KeyFund. In order to continue to develop and improve this central resource for Manchester, we are looking for businesses to sponsor us as part of their CSR. If you are interested in becoming a Street Support partner, please contact us at <a href="partnership@streetsupport.net">partnership@streetsupport.net</a>.</p>
