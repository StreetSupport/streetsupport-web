      <h2 class="h2">Our Team</h2>

      <p>We have a core team of 5 people based in Manchester, 2 of us have lived experience of homelessness. Each location we are active in has a local co-ordinator, supported by organisations and volunteers.</p>

        <span class="btn__text">About our team</span>
      </a>

      <p>We use research, co-production, human centered design and creative technology to develop online tools that make it easier for people experiencing homelessness to get help. We also facilitate discussion and co-production, and work behind the scenes to connect the network. Here is a little story of where this idea came from:
        <a href="/about/how-this-started/">How this started.</a>
      </p>

      <h2 class="h2">Our Organisation</h2>
      <p>Street Support Network Ltd is a Registered Charity [1177546]. We have been funded by donations from local philanthropists and friends, small grants, and business sponsorship. We always pay at least the real living wage.</p>
      <p>In order to continue to develop and improve this central resource, to facilitate change through building this network, and to provide more opprtunities for people experiencing homelessness, we need businesses to partner with us. If you are interested in supporting us, please contact Gary at

      </a>

      <h2 class="h2">Partnership</h2>
      <p>We work in partnership with people experiencing homelessess, charities and voluntary groups, public and private sector, and concerned citizens. Together we co-produce new features to meet different needs, and are continually improving the site based on user feedback. In addition to providing the online network, we also work behind the scenes to connect people and facilitate collaborative workshops.</p>
