      <p>Street Support Network works online and offline, connecting and supporting local people and organisations to End Homelessness.</p>
      <p>Our vision is a citizen-led network, where people with personal insight into homelessness, decision makers and people with resources co-create effective solutions together.</p>
      <p>This website is a central place online to find out about homelessness, see what support is available, and see what you can do to help.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="/find-help/">Find Help</a>: See what support services are available near you, how to access them, and where there are gaps.</li>
        <li>
          <a href="/give-help/">Give Help</a>: See how you can help organisations to provide better support - volunteer, offer items, or donate money.</li>
        <li>
          <a href="http://news.streetsupport.net/">News</a>: Understand more about homelessness in your area, what is being done, and where the challenges and opportunities are.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We also work offline, connecting people to co-produce better solutions, facilitating conversation and co-ordinating action. Everything we do starts by listening to people with personal insight into homelessness and frontline workers. We use research, co-production, human centered design and creative technology to develop tools and improve systems. Here is the story of <a href="/about/how-this-started/">how this started.</a></p>
