      <p>Street Support Network is a central online resource around homelessness in a city, currently available in Greater Manchester, Leeds, Bradford, Bournemouth, Portsmouth & Liverpool, with other cities keen to join.</p>
      <p>We have a simple mission - to make it easier for people who are homeless to get the help they need...</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="/find-help/">Find Help</a>: Find local services based on need - see exactly when and where help is available, and where there are gaps.</li>
        <li><a href="/give-help/">Give Help</a>: Find out what you can do to help - see what is needed across all organisations, volunteer, offer items, or donate.</li>
        <li><a href="http://news.streetsupport.net/">News</a>: Learn about homelessness in the city - stories, information, and updates on what is being done to improve things.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We make it easier for the local network of services to collaborate, co-ordinate and provide better support for people experiencing homelessness, and we make it easier for citizens and businesses to DO something to help. Many small, co-ordinated actions add up to a big difference to homeless people in the city.</p>
      <p>Our long term vision is a place-driven citizen-led support network, with people with personal lived experience of homelessness at the centre.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">Organisation Registration</h2>
      <p>The network includes organisations from across different sectors that provide useful services for people who are homeless. As a trusted source of information, the local network set minimum standards around who is included - see our standards toolkit for information on the criteria we use in Manchester.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">Information Quality</h2>
      <p>Please note, all information is provided by organisations in the network, so while we make every effort to ensure it is kept up to date, we can't always guarantee the accuracy of information that is entered by third parties. Please <a href="/contact">get in touch</a> if you spot anything that is incorrect or missing.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">Our Team</h2>
      <p>We have a small core team of 4 people based in Manchester, 2 of which have recent lived experience of homelessness. Each city also has a local network and co-ordinator, and we are supported by a network of digital experts and volunteers.</p>
      <a href="/about/our-team/" class="btn btn--brand-d btn--in-copy"><span class="btn__text">Our Team</span></a>

      <p>We use research, co-production, human centered design and creative technology to develop online tools that make it easier for people experiencing homelessness to get help. We also facilitate discussion and co-production, and work behind the scenes to connect the network. Here is a little story of where this idea came from: <a href="/about/how-this-started/">How this started.</a></p>

      <h2 class="h2">Our Network</h2>
      <p>We work in partnership with people experiencing homelessess, charities and voluntary groups, public and private sector, and concerned citizens. We work together to co-produce new features to meet the needs of those who will use them, and are continually improving the site based on user feedback. In addition to providing the online network, we also work behind the scenes to connect people and facilitate collaborative workshops.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">Our Organisation</h2>
      <p>We are a not for profit company, currently waiting for our official charity status. We have been funded so far by donations from local philanthropists, friends, small grants, a loan from KeyFund, and business sponsorship. We always pay at least the real living wage for the area. We are an open and transparent organisation, so please get in touch if you have any further questions.</p>
      <p>In order to continue to develop and improve this central resource, and to facilitate change through the network, we are looking for businesses to sponsor us to help grow out team, providing more opportunities for people who have experienced homelessness. If you are interested in supporting us, please contact Gary at <a href="mailto:gary@streetsupport.net">gary@streetsupport.net</a>, or on 07824 667709.</p>
