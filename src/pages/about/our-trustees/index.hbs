        <p>I provide support to Viv and Gary on business matters such as legal and finance, raising funds and strategy. Previously I was finance director for a housing association and more recently I provided consultancy services in that sector. My experience of the challenges around tackling homelessness attracted me to the great work that Street Support does and in particular it's inclusive and collaborative approach.</p>

        <p>My role as a trustee for Street Support Network is to use my experience of working in the voluntary sector to advise and support the team. I have spent over 16 years working for charities, and have been part of the staff team at Mustard Tree (a local charity with a focus on tackling poverty and preventing homelessness) since 2008. I played a central role in the creation and development of the Manchester Homelessness Partnership, and am passionate about the power of connecting people with different backgrounds and experiences to co-produce change. I have been impressed from the start with the vital role that the team at Street Support have played in doing this, by acting as a central hub of information, communication and support for the homelessness sector in Greater Manchester. I hope that my input can both inform and inspire this growing team.</p>

        <p>I have worked in the housing & homelessness sector for over 30 years after graduating with a Housing Degree from Sheffield Hallam way back in the 80’s, starting out as a front line Homelessness Officer and progressing in local government to heading up a Housing & Benefits Service. I am now enjoying part time work in the charitable sector, most recently with Homeless Link. I’m still passionate about tackling homelessness and the need for collaboration and partnership amongst all those in the sector. I am also a Trustee of Housing Justice.</p>

        </div>
        <p>I am passionate about reducing inequalities for people experiencing homelessness. I believe the way to effectively do this is to combine expertise and resources from a range of different sectors and provide the opportunity for people with lived experience  of homelessness to input into the design and delivery of strategies and services.  I have over 8 years experience working in homeless health for the NHS and the voluntary sector and have strong links with stakeholders in Greater Manchester through my employment at Urban Village Medical Practice and now nationally through my role as #HealthNow Network Coordinator at Groundswell. I was fortunate enough to contribute to conversations in the early development of Street Support and I feel very privileged to join the board of trustees now to support the ongoing development of the network.</p>

          <h2 class="h2">Charles Gray - Finance & Business Admin</h2>
        </div>
        <p>I'm responsible for managing the Finances and Business Admininstration for Street Support. This includes producing the management accounts, processing invoices and making payments. I get involved with Grant applications and the admin associated with our charitable status. I also assist the directors and trustees with business advice.</p>
        <p>I was previously Managing Director and Finance Director for a logistics company and come from a finance background having qualified as a Chartered Accountant.</p>
        <p>For some time I have wanted to step back from corporate life and apply my experience to more charitable purposes. I was delighted to get the opportunity to assist Street Support from its inception. I was really impressed with the founders' enthusiasm and dedication to deliver real solutions to relieve the hardships caused by homelessness. They have achieved so much from such a low level of resources and it has been a pleasure to support them along the way.</p>
