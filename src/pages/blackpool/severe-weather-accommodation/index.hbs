      <h3>Winter Provision (extended SWEP)</h3>
      <p>During the winter months, the Housing Options Team will be intensifying their efforts to actively engage with rough sleepers, providing offers of support and accommodation where possible. Housing Options has begun this approach now and will continue to the end of March.</p>
      <p>So we can ensure offers of accommodation are suitable and to ensure appropriate health support is also available, initial assessments will be completed with rough sleepers by the Housing Options Team before placement.</p>
