      <p>If you've just become homeless, or feel that there is a risk of that happening, it's important to get the right advice as soon as possible. There is a range of support available, depending on your situation.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">Presenting as Homeless</h2>
      <p>If you are homeless, at risk of homelessness, or want advice on what housing options are available, visit our Bournemouth Council Housing Options Team at the Town Hall in Bournemouth between 9 am and 4.30pm Monday to Thursday, and between 9am and 4pm on a Friday.</p>
      <p>If you become homeless outside of these times on a weekday, or anytime on a weekend or bank holiday, call the Emergency Out Of Hours Team on <a href="tel:01202 451467">01202 451467</a>. The team will assess your circumstances, and depending on the outcome of this you may be offered accommodation.</p>
