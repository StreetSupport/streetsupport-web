        <p class="quote__body text-center">It Takes a City – A Cambridge Homelessness Partnership - provides a framework and mechanism to enable the city to unite and take action to end rough sleeping in the city due to homelessness.</p>
      </div>

      <h2 class="h2">Who are we and why are we here?</h2>
      <p><span class="italic">It Takes a City</span> was established in 2019 in response to the Cambridge Summit on Homelessness, held in November 2018.</p>
      <p>We believe no one agency or authority can tackle the problem of homelessness on their own. It Takes a City is both a generous offer to the authorities and existing agencies from the wider community, and a way that the wider community can work in partnership at all levels with the authorities, existing agencies and those with lived experience of homelessness to co-produce solutions which lead to sustained change.</p>
      <p><span class="italic">It Takes a City</span> brings together those with lived experience, managers and front-line workers, members of faith communities, public sector officials, business owners and managers, teachers, academics, students and concerned individuals. </p>
      <p>Cambridge is a city on the world stage that has invented, solved, inspired and delivered huge change to humankind.  We believe the city possesses what is needed – ideas, imagination, intelligence, expertise, wealth and humanity.  Everyone in Cambridge can be part of radical, lasting solutions, and feel good about it.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">Our Vision:</h2>
      <div class="quote">
        <p class="quote__body text-center">To end rough sleeping in Cambridge due to homelessness, making sure everyone has somewhere to call home, with the support they need.</p>
      </div>
      <p>We want to unite Cambridge to collaborate and harness resources; leading to lasting change. To do this, we follow two guiding principles:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Co-production: People experiencing homelessness and experts by experience will shape the services designed to support them.</li>
        <li>Collaboration: People from all sectors of our community committed to a shared vision, coming together to make a lasting difference.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We believe that everyone living in Cambridge should have:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A home which is safe, suitable and sustainable.</li>
        <li>Person-centred, tailored support for their journey out of homelessness.</li>
        <li>Protection from violence, abuse, and discrimination.</li>
        <li>Equality of access to information, education and employment opportunities.</li>
        <li>Ways to function and flourish within their own community.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="h2">Action Groups:</h2>
      <div class="quote">
        <p class="quote__body text-center">Solutions are designed within Action Groups bringing together all with a shared interest in a different outcome. Solutions are delivered by Action Group members, funded by various means.</p>
      </div>
      <p>Each of the Action Groups focus on a specific issue which affects people experiencing homelessness in Cambridge.  Each group develops its own collaborative actions to tackle that issue, with the following core values:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lived Experience - Homeless people, and those with past experience of being homeless, are shaping the process and owning the outcomes.</li>
        <li>Subject expertise - We don't need to try to reinvent the wheel!</li>
        <li>Locally do-able - Realistic actions that can be achieved together by the community.</li>
        <li>Clear, action-orientated goals and objectives that lead to sustained change.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The action group themes are:</p>
      <ul>
