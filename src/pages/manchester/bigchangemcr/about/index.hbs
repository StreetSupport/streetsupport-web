        <p>Your donation joins the central Big Change funding pot. <a href="/manchester/bigchangemcr/partners/">Local charities and organisations</a> work directly with individuals who are homeless, and apply for funds to pay for items they need. Depending on the amount needed, there are two levels of fund requests.</p>

        <p>Individuals who are homeless receive the items they need, purchased using your donation.

        <h2 class="h2">What does Big Change pay for?</h2>
        <p>Big Change recognises that people who are homeless often face practical barriers which need to be overcome for them to become active, independent members of their community and avoid sleeping rough.</p>
        <p>Big Change provides homeless people with practical items which support a long term change.  This might include paying for a deposit for a home, a training course to help improve job prospects and clothes for a job interview.  Or it could involve furnishing a new flat, including purchasing crockery, pots, pans and bed linen, as well as funding travel costs to their new home.</p>

      {{>divider class="is-hidden--smallscreen"}}

      <div class="block__section">
        <h2 class="h2">Why is Big Change a more effective way to give?</h2>
        <p>Although giving money to people begging on the street seems supportive, it doesn’t help individuals get away from sleeping rough, or address the complicated range of reasons which made them homeless.</p>
        <p>By working in partnership with charities and organisations providing frontline services for homeless people, the Big Change Fund enables individuals to make lasting positive change. The organisations stay in touch with the individuals who receive money from the fund to provide long term support.</p>

      {{>divider class="is-hidden--smallscreen"}}

      <div class="block__section">
        <h2 class="h2">Who is behind Big Change?</h2>
        <p>The Big Change action group is part of <a href="http://charter.streetsupport.net">Manchester Homelessness Charter</a>. The group includes people with lived experience of homelessness, organisations who provide support to people on the streets, the council, universities and businesses.</p>

        <h2 class="h2">Who decides how the fund is spent?</h2>
        <p>The Big Change panel includes: one representative from an established organisation; two representatives from member organisations of Manchester’s Coalition of Relief; one ex-rough sleeper who is in long term support; and one representative from CityCo.</p>
        <p>We know it’s important to make the application process simple and quick for the Big Change fund to effectively help people who are homeless. That’s why for items under &pound;100, our partner organisations and charities can claim through an online application form (only agencies who have signed the Big Change agreement have access to this form).</p>
        <p>For items over &pound;100 the Big Change panel reviews each application against the guidelines for the fund and checks if there are any other opportunities available which could fulfil the request. Decisions are made within 48 hours.</p>
