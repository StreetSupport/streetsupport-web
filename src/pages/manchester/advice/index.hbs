      <p>If you've just become homeless, or feel that there is a risk of that happening, it's important to get the right advice as soon as possible. There is a range of support available, depending on your situation&hellip;</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If you're <strong>comfortable dealing with council services</strong>, you can go to the town hall to present as homeless. Read the <a href="#register-homeless">Presenting as Homeless</a> section below for information on how to proceed.</li>
        <li>If you would like <strong>someone to support you through the process</strong>, there are a number of day centres that can advise you on suitable options. Read the <a href="#support-into-services">Support into Services</a> section below for details.</li>
        <li>You can also find many other services to help you through the 'Find Help' section of this site including <a href="/find-help/dropin/timetable/">drop in centres</a>.</p>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="h2">Help for Rough Sleepers</h2>
      <p>If you <strong>see someone sleeping rough</strong>, and don't know how to help, you can use the <a href="https://www.streetlink.org.uk/StreetLinkActionVF">Street Link service</a> to notify the council about a rough sleeper anywhere in the country. If you know someone who has become homeless, you can follow the steps below on their behalf.</p>
      <p>If you are in Manchester City Centre, you can call the council Rough Sleeper Team on 0161 234 5339 or email <a href="mailto:roughsleepersteam@manchester.gov.uk">roughsleepersteam@manchester.gov.uk</a>.

      <h2 class="h2" id="register-homeless">Presenting as Homeless</h2>
      <p>If you have just become homeless, or might do in the next 28 days, the first thing to do is <strong>apply as homeless</strong> at your local council. The homelessness service is an <strong>emergency service</strong>, and you can also get advice or help to stay in your home.</p>
      <p>If the council accepts you are homeless, they take on a <strong>duty of care</strong> which means they will try to house you <strong>immediately</strong>. You will then be "in the system”, and able to access other services for homeless people.</p>

      <h2 class="h2" id="council-info">Help from your Council</h2>
