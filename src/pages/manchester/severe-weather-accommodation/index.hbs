      <p>During periods of severe cold weather, additional emergency accommodation is provided by councils.</p>

      <p>Adverse weather provision is provided when the weather is forecast to be sub zero. At this point the usual guidelines over who the council has a duty to provide emergency accommodations for are lifted, and extra provision is made for rough sleepers, regardless of their status.</p>

      <p>Councils work in partnership with local organisations and housing providers to make this additional accommodation available, covering the accommodation and staff costs.</p>

      <p>There are outreach workers covering different areas in the city to connect with people who are rough sleeping and helping them to get inside if they want to. Each individual is assessed so that appropriate accommodation can be found based on their needs.</p>

      <p>There could be cases where accommodation providers may feel that they are not able to accommodate someone for example through violent behaviour, but the underlying principles of SWEP mean that every effort is made to find somewhere suitable.</p>
