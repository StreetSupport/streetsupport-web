      <p>If you've just become homeless, or feel that there is a risk of that happening, it's important to get the right advice as soon as possible. There is a range of support available, depending on your situation&hellip;</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If you're <strong>comfortable dealing with council services</strong>, you can go to the town hall to present as homeless. Read the <a href="#register-homeless">Registering as Homeless</a> section below for information on how to proceed.</li>
        <li>If you would like <strong>someone to support you through the process</strong>, there are a number of day centres that can advise you on suitable options. Read the <a href="#day-centres">Support into Services</a> section below for details.</li>
        <li>You can also find many other services listed on this site including <a href="/find-help/category/?category=dropin">drop in centres</a>.</p>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="h2">Helping Rough Sleepers</h2>
      <p>If you <strong>see someone sleeping rough</strong>, and don't know how to help, you can call the council Rough Sleeper Team on 0161 234 5339 or email <a href="mailto:roughsleepersteam@manchester.gov.uk">roughsleepersteam@manchester.gov.uk</a>.</p>
      <p>Alternatively you can use the <a href="http://www.streetlink.org.uk/tell-us-about-a-rough-sleeper">Street Link service</a> to notify the council about a rough sleeper anywhere in the country. If you know someone who has become homeless, you can follow the steps below on their behalf.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">Registering as Homeless</h2>
      <p>If you have just become homeless, or might do in the next 28 days, the first thing to do is <strong>apply as homeless</strong> at your local council. The homelessness service is an <strong>emergency service</strong>, and you can also get advice or help to <a href="http://www.manchester.gov.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?categoryID=200117&amp;documentID=1428">stay in your home</a>.</p>
      <p>If the council accepts you are homeless, they take on a <strong>duty of care</strong> which means they will try to house you <strong>immediately</strong>. You will then be "in the system”, and able to access other services for homeless people. You can visit the town hall, or call Manchester City Council's team on 0161 234 4692 Mon-Fri between 9am - 4.30pm, or out of hours in an emergency you can call 0161 234 5001.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">Support into Services</h2>

They can also refer you into accommodation and other services, where appropriate.</p>
