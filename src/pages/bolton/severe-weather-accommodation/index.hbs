      <p>During periods of severe cold weather, additional emergency accommodation is provided by councils. This winter, we are aiming to provide A Bed Every Night for people who are rough sleeping in Greater Manchester. Find out more at <a href="http://streetsupport.net/gm">streetsupport.net/gm</a>.</p>

      <p>When there is severe weather, additional emergency beds are made available for people to move inside.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>During the day, ring Bolton Town Hall on <a href="tel:01204333333">01204 333333</a>.</li>
        <li>Out of hours you can refer via the duty social worker <a href="tel:01204337777">01204 337777</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There are outreach workers covering different areas in the city to connect with people who are rough sleeping and helping them to get inside if possible. Each individual is assessed so that appropriate accommodation can be found based on their needs.</p>
