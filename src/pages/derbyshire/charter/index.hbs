      <p>We believe that every person experiencing homelessness in Derbyshire should have a right to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Have their voice heard and a choice in their own future.</li>
        <li>Be treated with dignity and respect.</li>
        <li>A safe, secure and sustainable home.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We believe that all those who work with people experiencing homelessness in Derbyshire should:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Take a holistic, person-centred approach to supporting people that considers their individual needs.</li>
        <li>Encourage effective system-wide communication and collaboration to target early intervention.</li>
        <li>Not penalise people for past mistakes, recognising that recovery from homelessness is not always linear.</li>
      </ul>
