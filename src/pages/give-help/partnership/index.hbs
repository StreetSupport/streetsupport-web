    	<h2 class="h2">What do we need?</h2>
      <p>We are looking for businesses or organisations to sponsor the development of Street Support, in turn supporting over 35 organisations that work with people experiencing homelessness in Manchester.</p>
      <p>In order to continue to develop and improve the website, and to add more of the features that organisations are asking for, we need to cover our running costs averaging &pound;10k per month. This pays for a skilled and experienced team of digital experts who are working at reduced rates, aswell as minimal hosting costs.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">Why is this important?</h2>
      <p>With homelessness number rising, and ongoing cuts to services, this central and neutral facilitation role is vital. Organisations resources are limited, and it isn’t easy for them to co-ordinate. Nobody else is doing this.</p>
      <p>This is about Manchester doing the right thing – businesses, the council, charities, communities and individuals. We know what is being asked for and what is needed. With this funding we can provide effective solutions quickly.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">What are the benefits for your organisation?</h2>
      <p>This central resource is being used city-wide, with user numbers increasing each week. By sponsoring Street Support, you will be supporting over 35 Manchester charities and voluntary groups working to end homelessness.</p>
      <p>We will include a full list of sponsors on the site, and major sponsors will be featured on the homepage.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">What else is in the pipeline?</h2>
      <p>Aswell as further user testing and improvements to the current site, and including services from other locations, we have a list of requests that organisations feel would help them support people more effectively. Here are some of the features on our backlog&hellip;</p>
      <ul>
        <li>User testing and improvements to the current site: £4,000</li>
        <li>Develop a central skills and resources search function: £5,000</li>
        <li>Expand the site to include services in Greater Manchester: £6,000</li>
        <li>Create a public impact dashboard to increase transparency: £4,000</li>
        <li>Add download and print features for those without internet access: £3,000</li>
        <li>Add a map view for finding organisations and services: £3,000</li>
        <li>Create and publicise resources for education around homelessness: £5,000</li>
        <li>Pay for someone experiencing homelessness to work with us: Est £1,000/month</li>
      </ul>
      <p>And here are some of the things that have already been generously funded by local organisations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Launch The Manchester Homelessness Charter: £10,000</li>
        <li>Apple and Android app versions of Street Support: £6,000</li>
      </ul>
