    <h2 class="h2">Help us End Homelessness in your area</h2>

    <p>Street Support Network is an independent charity that connects people and organisations to work together to End Homelessness. Our website is the ONE place to go to find out about homelessness locally, and to do something to help.</p>

    <p>We are a small team with a big mission. Our work is funded by donations from local businesses and philanthropists that care about homelessness and share our values. To continue to develop Street Support Network, and support change in our featured locations, we need local businesses to partner with us and/or raise funds for us.</p>

    <h2 class="h2">Why do we need your help?</h2>

    <p>Homelessness has reached crisis levels in many UK cities. Ongoing cuts to services, along with limited resources, has meant that organisations are finding it difficult to cope. They need to co-ordinate and increase the support they provide, but this isn’t easy. Street Support Network supports the whole system by increasing resources and making it easier for people to get help.</p>

    <p>We know what organisations need, to improve their service, and what the homeless community need to improve their situation. We just need funding to enable us to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Support Partnerships such as the Manchester Homelessness Charter, working alongside action groups.</li>
      <li>Research and communicate what is currently needed, connecting to available resources and volunteers.</li>
      <li>Develop and improve the website and app, co-producing new features with the homeless community.</li>
      <li>Pay skilled and experienced digital experts (who all work at reduced rates).</li>
      <li>Inspire and inform those that might be able to help, through information and stories.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="h2">How you can help</h2>

    <p>Through partnership working, there is now a clear mission and a network of collaboration, with people who have personally experienced homelessness included at every level. There is a real chance to improve the situation in the city, but resources are limited. We need funding and strong partnerships to enable us to support this process.</p>

    <p>In addition to the ongoing work that is needed, the organisations, and homeless community have more ideas for features that they feel would be useful. We need your help so we can work alongside these groups to co-produce solutions, and continue to make a real difference. Here are some examples…</p>
    <ul>
      <li>£18k to provide a years employment at Street Support for a GROW trainee (someone experiencing homelessness).</li>
    </ul>
