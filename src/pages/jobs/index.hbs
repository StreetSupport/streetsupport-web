      <h2>Full-Stack DotNet developers</h2>

      <p>We are looking for DotNet full stack developers to support our mission to end homelessness.</p>

      <p>Street Support Network is charity based in Manchester, UK. Our mission is to make it easier for anyone experiencing homelessness to get the help they need. Through our website, and working offline, we connect people experiencing homelessness, over 180 charities and grassroots groups, businesses and citizens. What we build is co-produced with people who have lived experience of homelessness and frontline organisations. We are part of Manchester Homelessness Partnership, and our network now extends to several other cities.</p>

      <p>We are looking for an experienced DotNet developer who can drive quality and technical direction of the overall solution. We also welcome applications from junior developers with DotNet skills who can pick up a range of smaller changes and feature requests.</p>

        <li>Azure, MongoDB</li>
        <li>Git, UX design understanding, Test driven development, Continuous Integration, Automation</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We run our team on an agile basis, with short release cycles, responding to the changing needs of the network. Priorities are decided on by an internal product owner, and tickets are currently organised and assigned through Trello. Source is stored in GitHub and there is a quick setup routine. Our team use Slack to communicate when working remotely.</p>
