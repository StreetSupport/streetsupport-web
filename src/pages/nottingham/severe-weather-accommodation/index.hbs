      <h3 class="h3">Accommodation</h3>
      <p>The Street Outreach team (SOT) should always be contacted in the first instance by colleagues or members of the public coming across a rough sleeper on <a href="tel:0800 066 5356">0800 066 5356</a> between 09:00 - 17:00, Monday - Sunday.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.emmanuelhouse.org.uk/winter-shelter">The Nottingham Night Shelter</a></p>
      <p>The Nottingham Shelter is run by Emmanuel House. Due to the communal nature of this service, it is not running in its usual format, ie. in dormitory style arrangements in church halls, however, there are a limited number of hotel beds available throughout the winter period.</p>
      <h3 class="h3">Access arrangements</h3>
      <p>Those wishing to access the winter shelter will need to be referred through Housing Aid or The Street Outreach team (SOT);
      It is strongly advised that anyone who is rough sleeping contact The Street Outreach Team on their 24 hour freephone telephone number on <a href="tel:0800 066 5356">0800 066 5356</a>.</p>

      <h2 class="h1 best-practice__header">Procedure for SWEP - out of hours</h2>
      <h3 class="h3">Process for a rough sleeper calling for emergency accommodation between 17:00 - 21:00, Monday to Sunday on a SWEP evening;</h3>
      <p>The individual calls SOT on 0800 066 5356 OR approaches a uniformed officer asking for accommodation;</p>
      <p>SOT/uniformed officer advises the individual to attend the triage service at London Road Fire Station, open from 18:00 - 21:00, Monday to Sunday;</p>
      <p>The individual will be assessed by SOT at the fire station and given hot drink/food by British Red Cross;</p>
      <p>The individual will be given the most appropriate accommodation for their needs;</p>
      <p>Taxi available if the individual has poor mobility;</p>
      <p>SOT will alert Housing Aid;</p>
      <p>Individuals will then be picked up by Housing Aid the following day and referred, where appropriate, to longer term accommodation/reconnected if possible.</p>
      <p>Calls after 21:00 will be dealt with over the phone by SOT. However, every effort will be made to ensure all rough sleepers are offered an option of accommodation before 21:00 during cold weather periods.</p>
