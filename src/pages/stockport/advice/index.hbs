      <p>If you would like support through the process, or if you don't qualify as legally homeless, it is best to go to one
        of the local <a href="/find-help/dropin/timetable/">drop in centres</a> who can advise you on what options
        are available for you.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">Emergency Accomodation in Winter</h2>
      <p>If you are aware of someone who is sleeping rough, please contact Stockport Homes on <a href="tel:01614744237">0161 474 4237</a> or email <a href="mailto:homechoice@stockporthomes.org">homechoice@stockporthomes.org</a> with details of when and where you saw them and what they looked like.</p>

      <p>There are outreach workers covering different areas in the city to connect with people who are rough sleeping and helping them to get inside if possible. Each individual is assessed so that appropriate accommodation can be found based on their needs.</p>

      <p>There could be cases where accommodation providers may feel that they are not able to accommodate someone for example through violent behaviour, but the underlying principles of SWEP mean that every effort is made to find somewhere suitable.</p>
