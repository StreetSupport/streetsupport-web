      <p>If you would like support through the process, or if you don't qualify as legally homeless, it is best to go to one of the local <a href="/find-help/dropin/timetable/">drop in centres</a> who can advise you on what options are available for you.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">Emergency Accomodation in Winter</h2>
      <p>During periods of severe cold weather, when forecast to fall to zero degrees or below, additional emergency accommodation is provided by the council. This is often called 'SWEP' - severe weather emergency provision.</p>
      <p>Provision can be accessed during office hours Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday 9am – 5pm, Thursday 9am – 6pm</p>
      <p>There is also a number for households who become homeless when the offices are closed: <a href="tel:0800 988 7061">0800 988 7061</a>.</p>
      <p>There are outreach workers covering different areas in the city to connect with people who are rough sleeping and helping them to get inside if possible. Each individual is assessed so that appropriate accommodation can be found based on their needs.</p>
      <p>There could be cases where accommodation providers may feel that they are not able to accommodate someone for example through violent behaviour, but the underlying principles of SWEP mean that every effort is made to find somewhere suitable.</p>
