      <p>During periods of severe cold weather, where temperatures of 0°or lower are predicted to last a minimum of 3 nights, additional  emergency accommodation will be provided for people that are rough sleeping in the borough under our local Severe Weather Emergency Protocol (SWEP).</p>
      <p>This year the Council, St Mungo’s, Faith Christian Group and Launchpad will be working with local accommodation providers to offer self-contained accommodation in line with COVID-19 guidance from central Government. You do not need to have recourse to public funds to access a severe weather placement.</p>
      <p>When considering whether to activate SWEP we also take into account other severe weather conditions such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>severe snowfall</li>
        <li>wind-chill</li>
        <li>widespread ice</li>
        <li>feels like temperatures</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Placements will last for the duration of the identified period of cold weather according to the predicted temperatures. </p>
