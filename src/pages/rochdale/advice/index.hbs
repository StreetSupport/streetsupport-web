      <p>If you would like support through the process, or if you don't qualify as legally homeless, it is best to go to one of the local <a href="/find-help/dropin/timetable/">drop in centres</a> who can advise you on what options are available for you.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">Emergency Accomodation in Winter</h2>
      <p>Cold Weather Services in Rochdale: For anyone that needs information they can contact our accommodation service at Leopold Court <a href="tel:01706923511">01706 923 511</a></p>

      <p>There are outreach workers covering different areas in the city to connect with people who are rough sleeping and helping them to get inside if possible. Each individual is assessed so that appropriate accommodation can be found based on their needs.</p>

      <p>There could be cases where accommodation providers may feel that they are not able to accommodate someone for example through violent behaviour, but the underlying principles of SWEP mean that every effort is made to find somewhere suitable.</p>
