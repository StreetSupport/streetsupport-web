      <p>Severe Weather Emergency Provision Protocol for Bournemouth and Poole has been triggered, and will remain in place until further notice.</p>
      <p>The BCP Street Outreach Service (BCPSOS) in conjunction with the BCP Council Housing team have set aside emergency accommodation for those who are sleeping on the street.  In advance of SWEP being activated they have been in contact with those known to be rough sleeping.</p>
      <p>When SWEP is activated, BCPSOS will work with partners to locate all those who are rough sleeping, and offer them a place within the assigned emergency accommodation.  Anyone with information to help find such a person should call the BCPSOS team on <a href="tel:01202 315962 ">01202 315962 </a> or email <a href="mailto:b&pstreetoutreach@mungos.org">b&pstreetoutreach@mungos.org</a></p>

      <ul>
        <li>Contact BCPSOS team on <a href="tel:01202 315962">01202 315962</a> or email <a href="mailto:b&pstreetoutreach@mungos.org">b&pstreetoutreach@mungos.org</a></li>
        <li>Dial 999 if someone needs emergency help.</li>
        <li>Remember that <a href="https://www.streetlink.org.uk/">Streetlink</a> is not an emergency service - we do not get the referrals immediately so it's best to use <a href="tel:01202315962">01202 315962</a> during periods that SWEP is activated.</li>
