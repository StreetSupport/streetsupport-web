      <h2 class="h2">Support services</h2>
      <p>If you would like support through the process, or if you don't qualify as legally homeless, it is best to go to one of the local <a href="/find-help/dropin/timetable/">drop in centres</a> who can advise you on what options are available for you.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">Emergency Accomodation in Winter</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>During office hours: Call the Housing Options Team on <a href="tel:01942487732">01942 487 732</a> or people can attend at The Brick, 10 Arcade Street, Wigan. If you are aware of a rough sleeper, please email <a href="mailto:roughsleep@wigan.gov.uk">roughsleep@wigan.gov.uk</a></li>
        <li>Out of hours: Referrals to be made via the duty social worker on <a href="tel:01942828777">01942 828 777</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>There are outreach workers covering different areas in the city to connect with people who are rough sleeping and helping them to get inside if possible. Each individual is assessed so that appropriate accommodation can be found based on their needs.</p>

      <p>There could be cases where accommodation providers may feel that they are not able to accommodate someone for example through violent behaviour, but the underlying principles of SWEP mean that every effort is made to find somewhere suitable.</p>
