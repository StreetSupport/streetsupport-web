      <p>If you would like support through the process, or if you don't qualify as legally homeless, it is best to go to one of the local <a href="/find-help/dropin/timetable/">drop in centres</a> who can advise you on what options are available for you.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">Emergency Accomodation in Winter</h2>
      <p>During periods of severe cold weather, when forecast to fall to zero degrees or below, additional emergency accommodation is provided by the council. The usual guidelines over who the council has a duty to provide emergency accommodations for are lifted, and extra provision is made for rough sleepers, regardless of their status. To establish whether or not this is a severe cold weather period, people are advised to contact your council.</p>
