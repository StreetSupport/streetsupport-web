        <li>Call 0113 222 4412 to request a telephone appointment or a home visit.</li>
        <li>In an emergency outside of office hours you can call 07891 273 939 (17:00-8:00.)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There is more <a href="https://www.leeds.gov.uk/residents/housing/housing-options/homelessness">official information on homelessness from Leeds council</a>, or you can contact Shelter for advice on 0808 800 4444.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">Housing Needs Assessment</h2>
      <p>Homelessness assessment revolves around the 5 tests of homelessness. These tests decide whether or not the council has a legal duty to rehouse you. Even if there is no legal duty the council will always provide extensive advice and assistance to resolve your housing need. Once the assessment is complete, the council can assist you with either staying in your current property or moving on into social or privately rented housing. If you are in urgent need, you may qualify for temporary accommodation but not before all other options have been explored.</p>
