      <p>If you are pregnant or have dependent children, it is important you go to your council straight away. Please read our <a href="/find-help/emergency-help/">emergency advice for your council</a> to find out about office hours and out of hours phone numbers.</p>

      <p>If you have no recourse to public funds but are a family, the level of support available might vary depending on your council, but you should still go to them for help as a first port of call.</p>
