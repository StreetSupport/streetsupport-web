      <p>It is important to register with your council if you are have recently been made homeless or are at risk of homelessness. In most places there are <a href="https://streetsupport.net/find-help/support/?&sub-category=younger-people">specialist support services for younger people</a> who can help you through the process.</p>

      <p>Please read our <a href="/find-help/emergency-help/">emergency advice for your area</a> to find out about your options, council office hours and important phone numbers.</p>

      <p>If you have no recourse to public funds but are under 25, the level of support available might vary depending on your council, but you should still go to them for help as a first port of call.</p>
