      <p>If you have recently been made homeless it is important that you <a href="/find-help/advice/councils">tell your council</a>. If you need support through the process, <a href="/find-help/dropin/timetable/">visit a local drop in centre</a>.</p>
      <p>The council will look into your situation and decide whether it has a duty to provide accommodation for you. They may
        offer <a href="#temporary" class="accom-type-link">temporary accommodation</a>, or decide that you need to stay at home or with a friend
        until they can find <a href="#settled" class="accom-type-link">settled accommodation</a>.</p>
      <p>If the council decides they do not have a duty of care, you will need to find your own accommodation. In most places
        there are local services who can offer advice and support, or you can <a href="http://england.shelter.org.uk/get_advice/homelessness">visit the Shelter website</a> or call their helpline on 0808 800 4444.</p>

            <p>In most locations there is a specific service for young people facing homelessness - <a href="/find-help/support/?&sub-category=younger-people">find local services for under 25s</a>. If you are in Manchester, you should <a href="/find-help/organisation/?organisation=ypsf">visit Centrepoint</a> to present as homeless rather than going to the council.</p>
            <p>If you are under 18 you are considered a child in the eyes of the law and your local council has a legal duty to support
              you. They may offer family mediation or find a place in foster care or hostels.</p>
            <p>If you have had a homelessness assessment with the council and it was unsuccessful, you may still be able to get a referral into other accommodation such as B&amp;Bs, or get financial help to pay a deposit.</p>
            <p>If you are a care leaver social services should continue to help you until you are 21, or up to 24 if you are studying
              full time.</p>
            <p>Centrepoint offer really good advice for young people aged 16-25 facing homelessness - you can get help by calling

            <p>It is really important to get the right advice as soon as you realise you are facing homelessness. If you think you might become homeless in the next 28 days, you can approach the council for help before you have to leave your house. They will advise you on what housing options and other services are available.
            <p>You can also seek advice from <a href="http://england.shelter.org.uk/get_advice/homelessness">Shelter</a> or a <a href="/find-help/support/?sub-category=housing">local housing advice service</a>.</p>
            <p>If you are evicted or you need to leave to escape violence or abuse, then you should be entitled to support. If you choose to move out of a house that you don't like, the council might class you as 'intentionally homeless' and they don’t have to house you.</p>

            <p>You will need to pay for this accommodation, but if you claim benefits or are on a low income you may be able to get housing benefit to cover the cost.

            <p>Most people can apply to go on their local council’s housing waiting list if you are <a href="http://england.shelter.org.uk/housing_advice/council_housing_association/who_is_eligible_to_apply_for_council_housing">eligible for assistance</a>, though some councils require you to have a local connection. There is generally a waiting list, so it is important to tell them you are facing homelessness early and be as flexible as you can. You can apply to more than one council and you can be on several lists at the same time. Waiting lists may be shorter in some areas.</p>
            <p>There can be issues if your account is restricted due to arrears, anti social behaviour or criminal offences. If this happens you will need to go to the housing office that deals with your application, so they can advise you on what the issue is and what needs to be done to get you back on system.</p>

            <p>The advantage of renting privately is that you have more choice over where you live, near to schools and family support. It is also much quicker to find a private rented home than to wait for a social rented home. You can use the internet in the library to look for vacancies at B&amp;Bs and hostels across the Greater Manchester area. Access your social media accounts and speak to friends and family and see if they can help.</p>

            <p>B&amp;Bs can be an expensive alternative to temporary accommodation and are not always safe. The rooms are charged on a night by night basis, but in some cases you might be able to stay there for the week if they are quiet. They may allow you to claim housing benefits, but you need to check what entitlement you would receive before signing an arrangement.</p>
            <p>This accommodation varies in quality and there is generally no support available as the properties are run by private landlords. There may be a local service that can support you if you have issues whilst living in this type of accommodation. <a href="https://www.justlife.org.uk/">JustLife</a> specialise in supporting people close to the streets in Manchester and Brighton, and have good knowledge of common issues facing people living in this type of accommodation.</p>
