      <p>If you have been told that the council are unable to help you, there are a number of options to consider. You may be able to access social housing, or find your own home in the private sector.</p>

      <p>If you would like support to find housing, visit a local <a href="/find-help/dropin/timetable/">drop in centre</a> or <a href="/find-help/support/?sub-category=housing">housing advice service</a> where you can get individual advice. You can also contact <a href="http://england.shelter.org.uk/get_advice/homelessness">Shelter</a> for advice via their national phone line on 0808 800 4444.</p

      <h3>Social housing</h3>
      <p>Most councils have information about how to apply for social housing on their website, or you can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/apply-for-council-housing">use this search by postcode</a>, or check our <a href="/find-help/accommodation/?sub-category=lettings-scheme">local letting scheme</a> list.</p>

      <p>Most people can apply to go on their local council’s housing waiting list if you are <a href="http://england.shelter.org.uk/housing_advice/council_housing_association/who_is_eligible_to_apply_for_council_housing">eligible for assistance</a>, though some councils require you to have a local connection. There is generally a waiting list, so it is important to register early and be as flexible as you can. You can apply to more than one council and you can be on several lists at the same time. Waiting lists may be shorter in some areas.</p>
      <p>There can be issues if your account is restricted due to arrears, anti social behaviour or criminal offences. If this happens you will need to go to the housing office that deals with your application, so they can advise you on what the issue is and what needs to be done to get you back on system.</p>

      <h3>Private rentals</h3>
      <p>The advantage of renting privately is that you have more choice over where you live, near to schools and family support. It is also much quicker to find a private rented home than to wait for a social rented home. You can use the internet in the library to look for vacancies at B&Bs and hostels across the Greater Manchester area. Access your social media accounts and speak to friends and family and see if they can help.</p>
      <p>TODO More sources for finding private rental accommodation, where to get financial help to pay a deposit etc.</p>

      <h3>Unsupported temporary accommodation (B&amp;Bs)</h3>
      <p>TODO Advice on UTAs and a link to local UTAs, and support services for people in UTAs.</p>
      <p>B&amp;Bs can be an extremely expensive alternative to temporary accommodation. This is because the rooms are charged on a night by night basis. But in some cases you might be able to stay there for the week if they are quiet. They may allow you to claim housing benefits from there, but you need to check what entitlement you would receive before signing an arrangement.</p>
      <p>This accommodation varies in quality and there is generally no support available as the properties are run by private landlords. There may be a local service that can support you if you have issues whilst living in this type of accommodation. <a href="https://www.justlife.org.uk/">JustLife</a> specialise in supporting people close to the streets, and have good knowledge of common issues facing people living in UTAs.</p>.
      <p>If this is your only option, browse our <a href="/find-help/accom/?sub-category=uta">list of unsupported temporary accommodation</a> near you.</p>

      <h3>Students</h3>
      <p>If you are currently studying and you are homeless, speak to your tutor or student union who may be able to offer assistance. They may have knowledge of student accommodation or grants to help you avoid interrupting your studies.</p>

      <h3>Other options</h3>
      <p>Speak to your local church or community to see if they have a contact who could accommodate you for a short period of time, or know of a local project. They may also be willing to listen and give advice on any personal issues you may be having.</p>
