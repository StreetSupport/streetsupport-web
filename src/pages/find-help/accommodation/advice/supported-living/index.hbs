      <p>It is important to register with your council if you have been made homeless or are at risk of homelessness. Please read our <a href="/find-help/emergency-help/">emergency advice for your area</a> to find out about council office hours and out of hours phone numbers.</p>

      <p>There are different types of supported accommodation depending on your needs. To understand more about the different options, read this <a href="http://england.shelter.org.uk/get_advice/housing_with_support">Shelter guide to supported housing</a>.</p>

      <p>To see what supported housing is available near you, browse our <a href="/find-help/accom/?sub-category=supported">supported housing list</a>. What options are available for you will depend on your location and situation, so please read the options carefully.</p>

      <p>If you need help to understand what options are suitable, visit a local <a href="/find-help/dropin/timetable/">drop in centre</a> or <a href="/find-help/support/?sub-category=housing">housing advice service</a> where you can get individual advice. You can also contact <a href="http://england.shelter.org.uk/get_advice/homelessness">Shelter</a> for advice via their national phone line on 0808 800 4444.</p>

      <p>You may also be able to access floating support to stay in your own home. Your council will be able to advise you on what is available in your area.</p>
