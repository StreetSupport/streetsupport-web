      <h2 class="h2">Help us end homelessness in Manchester</h2>
      <p>Street Support is an independent not for profit that connects the homeless community who need help, with over 40 organisations in the city who provide support.  Our website is the ONE place to go to find out about Manchester homelessness, and more importantly,to DO SOMETHING TO HELP.</p>
      <p>Our work is funded by donations from local businesses and philanthropists that care about this issue and share our values.  To continue to develop Street Support, and manage our day to day operations, we need further financial support, and we are looking to local businesses and organisations to partner with us.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">Why do we need your help?</h2>
      <p>The homelessness situation in Manchester has reached crisis level. Ongoing cuts to services, along with limited resources, has meant that organisations are finding it difficult to operate.  They need to co-ordinate better and make efficiencies, but this isn’t easy. Street Support provides the solution.</p>
      <p>We know what organisations need, to improve their service, and what the homeless community need to improve their situation.  We just need funding to enable us to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Support Manchester Homelessness Charter, working alongside the 10 action groups.</li>
        <li>Research and communicate what is currently needed, connecting to available resources and volunteers.</li>
        <li>Develop and improve the website and app, co-producing new features with the homeless community.</li>
        <li>Pay skilled and experienced digital experts (who all work at reduced rates).</li>
        <li>Inspire and inform those that might be able to help, through information and stories.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="h2">How you can help</h2>
      <p>Through Manchester Homelessness Charter, there is now a clear mission and a network of collaboration, with people who are homeless included at every level. There is a real chance to improve the situation in the city, but resources are limited. We need funding and strong partnerships to enable us to support this process.</p>
      <p>In addition to the ongoing work tha is needed, the organisations, and homeless community have more ideas for features that they feel would be useful.  We need your help so we can work alongside these groups to co-produce solutions, and continue to make a real difference. Here are some examples&hellip;</p>
      <ul>
        <li>£18k to provide a years employment at Street Support for a GROW trainee (someone experiencing homelessness).</li>
