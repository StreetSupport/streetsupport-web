      <h1>Manchester Digital Collective</h1>
      <p>The Manchester Digital Collective's vision is that everyone should have equal access and opportunity to the life enhancing benefits the digital world can provide.
      We're currently on the lookout for device donations over the Christmas period - by donating a device, you can help empower a vulnerable person by enabling them to connect to others in an increasingly digitalised society.
      When you donate your device, we'll wipe its data, clean and disinfect it and then distribute it to a vulnerable person in Manchester.</p>
